## Idea

To create a buddha box-like website where it would instantly experience meditative sounds.

For situations where you need to focus, or you don't want to have a song stuck in your head any longer.

## Music

The music is a curated playlist from content found on Archive.org. While other sites such as YouTube or SoundCloud would have also worked, I chose not to use them, because there is the risk that an advertisement would be included, which would be the antithesis of the purpose of this site.
